# StudentFees Smart Contract

## Vision

The **StudentFees** smart contract aims to provide a decentralized solution for managing student fee payments. The contract allows students to pay their fees directly via the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. By tracking payments and providing a clear record of each student's payment status and balance, the contract simplifies fee management for educational institutions and students alike.

## Flow Chart

The following flow chart illustrates the basic operations of the **StudentFees** smart contract:

+-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+ | | | | | | | Student Pays | | Contract | | Blockchain | | Fees | | Storage | | Network | | (payFees()) | | | | | | | | | | | +-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+ | | | | | | v v | +-------------------+ +-------------------+ | | Transaction | | Update Student | | | Sent | | Record | | | (Ether) | | - Increase | | | | | Balance | | +-------------------+ | - Set HasPaid | | | | - Emit FeePaid | | v +-------------------+ | +-------------------+ | | Payment Status | | | & Balance | | | Queries | | | (getPaymentStatus| | | getStudentBalance| | +-------------------+ |


## Future Scope

The **StudentFees** smart contract can be extended with the following features:

1. **Fee Structuring:** Support for multiple fee categories (e.g., tuition, lab fees) and partial payments.
2. **Refund Mechanism:** Implement functionality to handle refunds or reversals of payments.
3. **Access Control:** Introduce role-based access to manage records and permissions securely.
4. **User Interface:** Develop a web or mobile application to interact with the smart contract more intuitively.
5. **Automated Notifications:** Build a system to notify students about pending or overdue payments.
